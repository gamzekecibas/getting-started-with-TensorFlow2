***COURSE 1:*** *[Getting Started with TensorFlow2](https://github.com/gamzekecibas/tensorflow2-for-deep-learning/tree/main/getting-started-with-TensorFlow2)* 
* [01-convolutional-neural-network](https://github.com/gamzekecibas/tensorflow2-for-deep-learning/blob/main/getting-started-with-TensorFlow2/01-convolutional-neural-network.ipynb): It is first coding assignment in the project. It includes additional iterations such as increasing number of epochs,
  adding Dropout layer (dropout = 0.5), building smaller model, and changing padding type. [MNIST](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/mnist) dataset is used.   
* [02-model-validation](https://github.com/gamzekecibas/tensorflow2-for-deep-learning/blob/main/getting-started-with-TensorFlow2/02-model-validation.ipynb): 
It is second coding assignment in the course. Regularization techniques and callbacks methods of Keras library are studied. 
[Iris](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) dataset is used for the assignment.  
* [03-Capstone-project](https://github.com/gamzekecibas/tensorflow2-for-deep-learning/blob/main/getting-started-with-TensorFlow2/03-Capstone-project/03-capstone-project.ipynb): 
It is final project of the course. [SVHN](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/) dataset is used to train an MLP model and a CNN model using their guidelines. Previously studied
techniques are implemented to the project.
