[01-convolutional-neural-network](https://github.com/gamzekecibas/getting-started-with-TensorFlow2/blob/main/01-convolutional-neural-network.ipynb): A CNN model is built by Keras. *In Step07.* the model is fitted with different epochs and model architecture is iterated by ***dropout layer, network size and padding type in Conv2D layer.***
